# Appointment Scheduling System

## Problem Statement

This project is an online appointment scheduling system for a medical clinic. The system allows patients to request appointments without specifying a specific doctor. The platform internally assigns a doctor based on availability and handles a high volume of appointment requests, ensuring reliable scheduling even in the event of failures.

## Requirements

1. **Patient Appointment Booking**: Patients can view available appointment times and reserve slots.
2. **Doctor Assignment**: The system assigns an available doctor based on their schedule.
3. **Doctor Availability Management**: Doctors can set their availability and view their assigned appointments.
4. **High Volume Handling**: The system handles a large number of appointment requests with low latency.
5. **Fault Tolerance**: The system is fault-tolerant and can recover from server crashes, network issues, or other technical problems.
6. **Notifications**: Patients receive appointment confirmations and reminders via email or notifications.
7. **Admin Interface**: Clinic staff can manage doctor schedules and appointments through an admin interface.
